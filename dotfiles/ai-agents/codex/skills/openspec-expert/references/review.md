# Review and Sign-Off

All specs require sign-off by both Tech lead and QA before completion.

## Review Workflow

1. Share the spec diff and summary with reviewers.
2. Tech lead validates architecture, constraints, and feasibility.
3. QA validates acceptance criteria, testability, and edge cases.
4. Record sign-off status and any required changes.

## Sign-Off Checklist

- Requirements mapped to explicit acceptance criteria.
- Constraints and risks are documented.
- Test coverage and validation steps are clear.
- Diff summary reviewed and accepted by both roles.

## Audit Trail

- Capture reviewer names and approval timestamp in the output summary.
- Note any conditional approvals or follow-up actions.
