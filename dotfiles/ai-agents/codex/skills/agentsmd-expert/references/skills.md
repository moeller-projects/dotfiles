# Skills

## Guidance

- List skills with short descriptions and when to invoke them.
- Keep the list synchronized with available skills in the repo.
- Point to SKILL.md paths when needed.

## Example

```text
- `code-reviewer`: PR reviews and code quality checks
- `test-master`: testing strategies and implementation
```
